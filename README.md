If you want to try it out, open in Unity, set gameview resolution to Full HD and play from persistent scene!

If you want to try it out and don't want to bother with Unity, let me know and I'll upload a build.

HOW TO PLAY: Use left click to shoot enemy slimes. Use right click to shoot upwards, toward spawners or flying enemies.
